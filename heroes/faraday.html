                <h2>Biography</h2>
                <p>Michael Faraday, (born September 22, 1791, Newington, Surrey, England—died August 25, 1867, Hampton Court, Surrey),
                English physicist and chemist whose many experiments contributed greatly to the understanding of electromagnetism.</p>

                <p>Faraday, who became one of the greatest scientists of the 19th century, began his career as a chemist. He wrote a manual
                of practical chemistry that reveals his mastery of the technical aspects of his art, discovered a number of new organic
                compounds, among them benzene, and was the first to liquefy a “permanent” gas (i.e., one that was believed to be
                incapable of liquefaction). His major contribution, however, was in the field of electricity and magnetism. He was the
                first to produce an electric current from a magnetic field, invented the first electric motor and dynamo, demonstrated
                the relation between electricity and chemical bonding, discovered the effect of magnetism on light, and discovered and
                named diamagnetism, the peculiar behaviour of certain substances in strong magnetic fields.</p>

                <p>Faraday was one of the major players in the founding of the new science of electrochemistry, which studies events at the
                interfaces of electrodes with ionic substances. Electrochemistry is the science that has produced the Li ion batteries
                and metal hydride batteries capable of powering modern mobile technology. Faraday’s laws are vital to our understanding
                of batteries and electrode reactions.</p>

                <p>Faraday discovered that when any electric conductor becomes charged, all the extra charge sits on the outside of the
                conductor. This means that the extra charge does not appear on the inside of a room or cage made of metal. </p>

                <p>Faraday discovered that when any electric conductor becomes charged, all the extra charge sits on the outside of the
                conductor. This means that the extra charge does not appear on the inside of a room or cage made of metal.</p>

                <p>In addition to offering protection for people, sensitive electrical or electrochemical experiments can be placed inside
                a Faraday Cage to prevent interference from external electrical activity.
                
                Faraday cages can also create dead zones for mobile communications.</p>

                <p>Faraday discovered that all substances are diamagnetic – most are weakly so, some are strongly so.
                Diamagnetism opposes the direction of an applied magnetic field.
                For example, if you held the north pole of a magnet near a strongly diamagnetic substance, this substance would be
                pushed away by the magnet.</p>

                <p>Diamagnetism in materials, induced by very strong modern magnets, can be used to produce levitation. Even living things,
                such as frogs, are diamagnetic – and can be levitated in a strong magnetic field.</p>

                <p>Michael Faraday died aged 75 on August 25, 1867 in London. He was survived by his wife Sarah. They had no children. He
                had been a devout Christian all of his life, belonging to a small branch of the religion called Sandemanians.
                
                During his life, he was offered burial in Westminster Abbey along with Britain’s kings and queens and scientists of the
                stature of Isaac Newton. He turned this down, in favor of a more modest resting place. His grave, where Sarah is also
                buried, can still be seen in London’s Highgate Cemetery.</p>
