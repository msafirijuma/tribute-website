            <h2>Biography</h2>
            <p><b>Albert Einstein 
            </b>was a German-born theoretical physicist, widely acknowledged to be one of the greatest physicists of all
            time. Einstein is best known for developing the theory of relativity, but he also made important contributions to the
            development of the theory of quantum mechanics.</p> 
            <p>Einstein always appeared to have a clear view of the problems of physics and the determination to solve them. He had a
            strategy of his own and was able to visualize the main stages on the way to his goal. He regarded his major achievements
            as mere stepping-stones for the next advance.</p>
            <p>At the start of his scientific work, Einstein realized the inadequacies of Newtonian mechanics and his special theory of
            relativity stemmed from an attempt to reconcile the laws of mechanics with the laws of the electromagnetic field. He
            dealt with classical problems of statistical mechanics and problems in which they were merged with quantum theory: this
            led to an explanation of the Brownian movement of molecules. He investigated the thermal properties of light with a low
            radiation density and his observations laid the foundation of the photon theory of light.</p>
            <p>In his early days in Berlin, Einstein postulated that the correct interpretation of the special theory of relativity
            must also furnish a theory of gravitation and in 1916 he published his paper on the general theory of relativity. During
            this time he also contributed to the problems of the theory of radiation and statistical mechanics.
            
            In the 1920s, Einstein embarked on the construction of unified field theories, although he continued to work on the
            probabilistic interpretation of quantum theory, and he persevered with this work in America. He contributed to
            statistical mechanics by his development of the quantum theory of a monatomic gas and he has also accomplished valuable
            work in connection with atomic transition probabilities and relativistic cosmology.</p>
            <p>Einstein’s researches are, of course, well chronicled and his more important works include Special Theory of Relativity
            (1905), Relativity (English translations, 1920 and 1950), General Theory of Relativity (1916), Investigations on Theory
            of Brownian Movement (1926), and The Evolution of Physics (1938). Among his non-scientific works, About Zionism (1930),
            Why War? (1933), My Philosophy (1934), and Out of My Later Years (1950) are perhaps the most important.</p>
            <p>Albert Einstein received honorary doctorate degrees in science, medicine and philosophy from many European and American
            universities. During the 1920’s he lectured in Europe, America and the Far East, and he was awarded Fellowships or
            Memberships of all the leading scientific academies throughout the world. He gained numerous awards in recognition of
            his work, including the Copley Medal of the Royal Society of London in 1925, and the Franklin Medal of the Franklin
            Institute in 1935.</p>
