                <h2>Biography</h2>
                <p>Isaac Newton, in full Sir Isaac Newton, (born December 25, 1642 [January 4, 1643, New Style], Woolsthorpe, Lincolnshire,
                England—died March 20 [March 31], 1727, London), English physicist and mathematician, who was the culminating figure of
                the Scientific Revolution of the 17th century. In optics, his discovery of the composition of white light integrated the
                phenomena of colours into the science of light and laid the foundation for modern physical optics. In mechanics, his
                three laws of motion, the basic principles of modern physics, resulted in the formulation of the law of universal
                gravitation. In mathematics, he was the original discoverer of the infinitesimal calculus. Newton's Philosophiae
                Naturalis Principia Mathematica (Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy, 1687) was one of the most important
                single works in the history of modern science.</p>

                <p>When Newton arrived in Cambridge in 1661, the movement now known as the Scientific Revolution was well advanced, and
                many of the works basic to modern science had appeared. Astronomers from Nicolaus Copernicus to Johannes Kepler had
                elaborated the heliocentric system of the universe. Galileo had proposed the foundations of a new mechanics built on the
                principle of inertia. Led by René Descartes, philosophers had begun to formulate a new conception of nature as an
                intricate, impersonal, and inert machine. Yet as far as the universities of Europe, including Cambridge, were concerned,
                all this might well have never happened. They continued to be the strongholds of outmoded Aristotelianism, which rested
                on a geocentric view of the universe and dealt with nature in qualitative rather than quantitative terms.</p>

                <p>Like thousands of other undergraduates, Newton began his higher education by immersing himself in Aristotle's work. Even
                though the new philosophy was not in the curriculum, it was in the air. Some time during his undergraduate career,
                Newton discovered the works of the French natural philosopher Descartes and the other mechanical philosophers, who, in
                contrast to Aristotle, viewed physical reality as composed entirely of particles of matter in motion and who held that
                all the phenomena of nature result from their mechanical interaction. A new set of notes, which he entitled “Quaestiones
                Quaedam Philosophicae” (“Certain Philosophical Questions”), begun sometime in 1664, usurped the unused pages of a
                notebook intended for traditional scholastic exercises; under the title he entered the slogan “Amicus Plato amicus
                Aristoteles magis amica veritas” (“Plato is my friend, Aristotle is my friend, but my best friend is truth”). Newto's
                scientific career had begun.</p>

                <p>Newton originally applied the idea of attractions and repulsions solely to the range of terrestrial phenomena mentioned
                in the preceding paragraph. But late in 1679, not long after he had embraced the concept, another application was
                suggested in a letter from Hooke, who was seeking to renew correspondence. Hooke mentioned his analysis of planetary
                motion—in effect, the continuous diversion of a rectilinear motion by a central attraction. Newton bluntly refused to
                correspond but, nevertheless, went on to mention an experiment to demonstrate the rotation of Earth: let a body be
                dropped from a tower; because the tangential velocity at the top of the tower is greater than that at the foot, the body
                should fall slightly to the east. He sketched the path of fall as part of a spiral ending at the centre of Earth. This
                was a mistake, as Hooke pointed out; according to Hooke's theory of planetary motion, the path should be elliptical, so
                that if Earth were split and separated to allow the body to fall, it would rise again to its original location. Newton
                did not like being corrected, least of all by Hooke, but he had to accept the basic point; he corrected Hooke's figure,
                however, using the assumption that gravity is constant. Hooke then countered by replying that, although Newton's figure
                was correct for constant gravity, his own assumption was that gravity decreases as the square of the distance. Several
                years later, this letter became the basis for Hooke's charge of plagiarism. He was mistaken in the charge. His knowledge
                of the inverse square relation rested only on intuitive grounds; he did not derive it properly from the quantitative
                statement of centripetal force and Kepler's third law, which relates the periods of planets to the radii of their
                orbits.</p>

                <p>Newton found time now to explore other interests, such as religion and theology. In the early 1690s he had sent Locke a
                copy of a manuscript attempting to prove that Trinitarian passages in the Bible were latter-day corruptions of the
                original text. When Locke made moves to publish it, Newton withdrew in fear that his anti-Trinitarian views would become
                known. In his later years, he devoted much time to the interpretation of the prophecies of Daniel and St. John, and to a
                closely related study of ancient chronology. Both works were published after his death.

                <p>1. Isaac Newton discovered gravity.</p>
                <p>2. He was born albeit prematurely and was not expected to survive since he was so tiny.</p>
                <p>3. Isaac Newton despised his step-father, he grew up lonely and separated from his mother. </p>
                <p>4. Isaac Newton's Mother wanted him to be a Farmer</p>
                <p>5. Being introverted and secretive, and a lonely person, he recorded his daily transgressions. This helped him
                let out his frustrations.</p>
                <p>6. He was quick tempered and had emotional breakdowns. This could be attributed to his lonely upbringing.</p>
                <p>7. He knighted by the Queen Anne</p>
                <p>8. Isaac Newton believed that seeing is believing</p>
                <p>9. He did not like competition. He always wanted the best for himself and always kept his brilliant
                discoveries to himself.</p>
                <p>10. He was the Stingy Bachelor, he did not get married. It is also believed that he never dated but dedicated his life to science.</p>
