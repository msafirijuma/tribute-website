                <h2>Biography</h2>
                <p>Steve Jobs, in full Steven Paul Jobs, (born February 24, 1955, San Francisco, California, U.S.—died October 5, 2011,
                Palo Alto, California), cofounder of Apple Computer, Inc. (now Apple Inc.), and a charismatic pioneer of the personal
                computer era.</p>
            
                <p>Jobs was one of the first entrepreneurs to understand that the personal computer would appeal to a broad audience, at
                least if it did not appear to belong in a junior high school science fair. With Jobs’s encouragement, Wozniak designed
                an improved model, the Apple II, complete with a keyboard, and they arranged to have a sleek, molded plastic case
                manufactured to enclose the unit.</p>

                
               <p>Though Jobs had long, unkempt hair and eschewed business garb, he managed to obtain financing, distribution, and
               publicity for the company, Apple Computer, incorporated in 1977—the same year that the Apple II was completed. The
                machine was an immediate success, becoming synonymous with the boom in personal computers. In 1981 the company had a
                record-setting public stock offering, and in 1983 it made the quickest entrance (to that time) into the Fortune 500 list
                of America’s top companies. In 1983 the company recruited PepsiCo, Inc., president John Sculley to be its chief
                executive officer (CEO) and, implicitly, Jobs’s mentor in the fine points of running a large corporation. Jobs had
                convinced Sculley to accept the position by challenging him: “Do you want to sell sugar water for the rest of your
                life?” The line was shrewdly effective, but it also revealed Jobs’s own near-messianic belief in the computer
                revolution.</p>
                <p>During that same period, Jobs was heading the most important project in the company’s history. In 1979 he led a small
                group of Apple engineers to a technology demonstration at the Xerox Corporation’s Palo Alto Research Center (PARC) to
                see how the graphical user interface could make computers easier to use and more efficient. Soon afterward, Jobs left
                the engineering team that was designing Lisa, a business computer, to head a smaller group building a lower-cost
                computer. Both computers were redesigned to exploit and refine the PARC ideas, but Jobs was explicit in favouring the
                Macintosh, or Mac, as the new computer became known. Jobs coddled his engineers and referred to them as artists, but his
                style was uncompromising; at one point he demanded a redesign of an internal circuit board simply because he considered
                it unattractive. He would later be renowned for his insistence that the Macintosh be not merely great but “insanely
                great.” In January 1984 Jobs himself introduced the Macintosh in a brilliantly choreographed demonstration that was the
                centrepiece of an extraordinary publicity campaign. It would later be pointed to as the archetype of “event marketing.”</p>
                <p>Jobs quickly started another firm, NeXT Inc., designing powerful workstation computers for the education market. His
                funding partners included Texan entrepreneur Ross Perot and Canon Inc., a Japanese electronics company. Although the
                NeXT computer was notable for its engineering design, it was eclipsed by less costly computers from competitors such as
                Sun Microsystems, Inc. In the early 1990s Jobs focused the company on its innovative software system, NEXTSTEP. </p>
                
                <p>Meanwhile, in 1986 Jobs acquired a controlling interest in Pixar, a computer graphics firm that had been founded as a
                division of Lucasfilm Ltd., the production company of Hollywood movie director George Lucas. Over the following decade
                Jobs built Pixar into a major animation studio that, among other achievements, produced the first full-length feature
                film to be completely computer-animated, Toy Story, in 1995. Pixar’s public stock offering that year made Jobs, for the
                first time, a billionaire. He eventually sold the studio to the Disney Company in 2006.</p> 
               
                
                <p>In 2001 Jobs started reinventing Apple for the 21st century. That was the year that Apple introduced iTunes, a computer
                program for playing music and for converting music to the compact MP3 digital format commonly used in computers and
                other digital devices. Later the same year, Apple began selling the iPod, a portable MP3 player, which quickly became
                the market leader. In 2003 Apple began selling downloadable copies of major record company songs in MP3 format over the
                Internet. By 2006 more than one billion songs and videos had been sold through Apple’s online iTunes Store. In
                recognition of the growing shift in the company’s business, Jobs officially changed the name of the company to Apple
                Inc. on January 9, 2007.</p> 
                
                <p>In 2007 Jobs took the company into the telecommunications business with the introduction of the touch-screen iPhone, a
                mobile telephone with capabilities for playing MP3s and videos and for accessing the Internet. Later that year, Apple
                introduced the iPod Touch, a portable MP3 and gaming device that included built-in Wi-Fi and an iPhone-like touch
                screen. Bolstered by the use of the iTunes Store to sell Apple and third-party software, the iPhone and iPod Touch soon
                boasted more games than any other portable gaming system. Jobs announced in 2008 that future releases of the iPhone and
                iPod Touch would offer improved game functionality. In an ironic development, Apple, which had not supported game
                developers in its early years out of fear of its computers not being taken seriously as business machines, was now
                staking a claim to a greater role in the gaming business to go along with its move into telecommunications.</p>
